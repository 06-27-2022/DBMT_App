Project 2: Abundant Gardens

Summary:
Food, the paradox! We all need it, we all love it, we don't all have access to it, and we also waste it! The USDA estimates that about 1lb of food per person in the United States is wasted each day. Yet, over 40 million families in the United States are unable to put dinner on the table. Counties, like San Diego, who implement federal SNAP programs (food stamps) often partner with local businesses and food banks to help supplement food resources for low-income families and individuals. Abundant Gardens aims to provide an interface for CalFresh (CF) customers to easily access leftiver meals from participating county restaurants and businesses.

The Customer Journey:
An existing CF customer can long into their profile and find a GPS map of all participating food banks and restaurants in the county.
I want to find extra food near me from local restaurants

I want <some feature>
GPS Location (for local participating restaurants or food trucks)
A place to write and read comments(maybe rate the restaurants/food as well)
Personalized QR Code for each household (to track their usage of the app)
Ability to follow other users
Options for delivery
etc...

So that <some reason>
We want our app to help low income families struggling to have basic needs, like food
to eat. We want the app to be a community, so that people in like situations can connect
and help each other.

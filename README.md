Project 2: Abundant Gardens

Summary:
Food, the paradox! We all need it, we all love it, we don't all have access to it, and we also waste it! The USDA estimates that about 1lb of food per person in the United States is wasted each day. Yet, over 40 million families in the United States are unable to put dinner on the table. Counties, like San Diego, who implement federal SNAP programs (food stamps) often partner with local businesses and food banks to help supplement food resources for low-income families and individuals. Abundant Gardens aims to provide an interface for CalFresh (CF) customers to easily access surplus meals from participating county restaurants and businesses.

The Customer Journey:
An existing CF customer can long into their profile and find a GPS map of all participating restaurants in the county. Restaurants will be organized by a star rating system tracking: Food Quality, Owner of Restaurant, Amount of times they donated food instead of throwing it out, Total amount (lbs) of food donated, etc

I want <some feature>
GPS Location (for local participating restaurants or food trucks)
A place to write and read comments(maybe rate the restaurants/food as well)
Personalized QR Code for each household (to track their usage of the app)
Ability to follow other users
Options for delivery

  

On the restaurant user side, owners/employees can log how much food (Ibs) they have at the end of the day.
Times where families can go and grab food, kind of the events
Ability to create an account as either a user or a restaurant
Users would consist of the low-income families that need the help to get food on their table. The create account screen/script can have the user enter yearly or monthly income to check if they are eligible for the program, number of total house residents (kids, relatives, spouses, etc.), location of home (so our gps location can point out restaurants in their general area in a mile radius)
Restaurants accounts would consist any food establishments who would like to help with the cause. The create account screen/scripts could include location of the restaurant (to give the users), maybe a general estimate of how much food they have left over on a daily basis, (add anything else you guys would like!)

So that <some reason>
We want our app to help low income families struggling to have basic needs, like food
to eat. We want the app to be a community, so that people in like situations can connect
and help each other.
  
 Reach Functionalities:
  - Add food banks

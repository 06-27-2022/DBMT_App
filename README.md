Project 2: Abundant Gardens

Summary:
  Food, the paradox! We all need it, we all love it, but we don't all have access to it, and we also waste it! The USDA estimates that about 1lb of food per person in the United States is wasted each day. Yet, over 40 million families in the United States are unable to put dinner on the table. Counties, like San Diego, who implement federal SNAP programs (food stamps) often partner with local businesses and food banks to help supplement food resources for low-income families and individuals. Abundant Gardens aims to provide an interface for CalFresh (CF) customers to easily access surplus meals from participating Live Well County Partner restaurants. The purpose is to bridge the ever growing divide between food scarcity and food waste in our communities.

The Household Journey:
  An existing CF customer can log into their profile which is linked to a unique case number assigned at the initial eligibility determination for the SNAP program. Households can then find a GPS map of all participating restaurants in the county. Each household will be assigned a personalized QR code to track their usage and confirm pick ups of resources. 

The Live Well Partner Journey: 
  Restaurants can log how much food (lbs) they have at the end of the day. Partners can also post pick up windows after business hours that will queue households by QR. Restaurants will be organized by a star rating system: 
  - Food Quality
  - Live Well rating
  - Amount of times they donated food instead of throwing it out 
  - Total amount (lbs) of food donated
  - User reviews/ratings
    
Core Functionalities:
  - Ability to login as household or partner
  - GPS locator
  - QR access code/tracker
  - Partner ability to open/close pickup windows and initiate "food queue"
  - Ratings filter
  
 Reach Functionalities:
  - Options for delivery
  - Add food banks
  - Restaurants can place themselves in a category when they sign up
      (Mexican cuisine, Asian Fusion, BBQ, TexMex, American cuisine, etc.) so that
      the households can input food preferences and be matched accordingly.
  - Users are able to input allergies/food restrictions
  - Users can leave a review that evaluates ease of pickup, satisfaction with
      food provided, and maybe even tips for other families picking up from this
      location.
